The character was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]. Lex Luthor originally appeared in \'\'[[Action Comics]]\'\' #23 (cover dated: April 1940). He has since endured as the [[archnemesis]] of the [[superhero]] [[Superman]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dccomics.com/characters/lex-luthor |title=Lex Luthor |website=dccomics.com |date=October 2012 |access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nLex Luthor was originally depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Since the late 1980s, he has more often been portrayed as the power-mad CEO of [[LexCorp]]. He wishes to rid the world of Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality envies Superman\'s popularity and influence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dccomics.com/characters/lex-luthor |title=Lex Luthor |date=October 2012 |publisher=dccomics.com |access-date=27 June 2015}}</ref> Given his high profile as a supervillain, however, he has often come into conflict with [[Batman]] and other [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Universe]].<ref name="Action Comics">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] |artist=Sikela, John |story=The Skeletons in Armor |editor=[[Whitney Ellsworth|Ellsworth, Whitney]] |title=[[Action Comics]] |issue=47 |date=April 1942 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |page=1}}</ref> Lex Luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers, but has above-average intelligence, a genius for inventions and a high command of science and technology. He occasionally wears his Warsuit, a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities. While Lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains in the likes of [[Metallo]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and [[Bizarro]], and frequently leading DC supervillain teams such as the [[Legion of Doom]], he has also been portrayed as an [[antihero]] who will ally himself with Superman and other heroes when situation calls for it.<ref name="Comics 166">{{Cite web |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/ |title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs.
