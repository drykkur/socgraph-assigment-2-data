The show is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, as well as [[cyberpunk]] and [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] themes such as the issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and scientific progress affecting society, and the psychology of the character of Bruce Wayne. In addition, due to the titular character being a high school student, it includes issues that plague teenagers (substance abuse, subcultures, child abuse and neglect, school violence, peer pressure, etc.). As such, it was considerably darker than most other children\'s programs at the time, although producer [[Bruce Timm]] recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly \'\'Batman\'\' cartoon.<ref name="mmv3">{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |date= June 1, 2004 |publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn= 978-1-893905-30-6 |page= 67 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&q=Bruce+Timm+kid-friendly+Batman+Beyond+cartoon&pg=PA67 |access-date= July 18, 2010}}</ref> It is also the first \'\'Batman\'\' series to portray the hero as a teenager. \'\'[[IGN]]\'\' named the show 40th on their list of "Top 100 Animated TV Series."<ref name="ign"/> The premise of \'\'Batman Beyond\'\' has been used in [[Batman Beyond (comics)|various comic book stories]] published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.'}}}]}}}
