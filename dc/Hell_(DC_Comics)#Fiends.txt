It is the locational [[antithesis]] of the Silver City in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. The DC Comics location known as Hell is based heavily on its depiction in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic mythology]]. Although several versions of Hell had briefly appeared before in various other DC Comics publications in the past, the official DC Comics concept of Hell was first properly established when it was mentioned in \'\'The Saga of the [[Swamp Thing (comic book)#Alan Moore|Swamp Thing]]\'\' (vol. 2) #25–27 (June–August 1984) and was first seen in \'\'Swamp Thing Annual\'\' #2 (1985), all of which were written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Stephen R. Bissette|Stephen Bissette]] and [[John Totleben]].\n\nThe [[hierarchy]] of Hell, specifically the triumvirate of  [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]], [[Azazel (DC Comics)|Azazel]], and [[Beelzebub]], was first referred to in \'\'[[Hellblazer|John Constantine, Hellblazer]]\'\' #12 (December 1988) ("The Devil You Know..." (page 6) by [[Jamie Delano]] and [[Richard Piers Rayner]]) and first appeared in \'\'[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]\'\' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989) ("A Hope in Hell" by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Sam Kieth]]); in the story, Lucifer had been forced to accept the position of the ruler of Hell due to the disruption caused by the Great Evil Beast\'s attack on Creation during the \'\'[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\'\' in the 16-part storyline "American Gothic" in \'\'Swamp Thing\'\' (vol. 2) #35–50 (April 1985–July 1986). \'\'John Constantine, Hellblazer,\'\' would also later add in the [[First of the Fallen]], who preceded Lucifer and his failed rebellion in Heaven. In \'\'[[Who\'s Who in the DC Universe#Who\'s Who in the DC Universe|Who\'s Who in the DC Universe]]\'\' #11 (July 1991), the entry on "Hell\'s Hierarchy" included all the elements of Gaiman\'s version, plus John Constantine the Hellblazer\'s demonic enemy Nergal, Agony and Ecstasy the Slave-Twins of the Inquisition,<ref>First seen in \'\'John Constantine, Hellblazer\'\' #12 (December 1988).</ref> Asteroth,<ref>First seen behind the scenes in \'\'The Demon\'\' (vol. 2) #1–4 (January–April 1987) and then fully in \'\'Action Comics Weekly\'\' #636–641 (the second story in each of the first five issues) (January 24–March 7, 1989).</ref> Abaddon the Destroyer, Morax and [[Superman]]\'s demonic enemy Blaze, who, along with her brother Satanus, came to rule Hell in the eight-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] \'\'[[Reign in Hell]]\'\' (September 2008–April 2009, also including \'\'DC Universe Special: Reign in Hell\'\' #1 (August 2008)).'}}}]}}}
