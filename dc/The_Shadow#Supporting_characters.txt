Gibson]]. Originating in [[Pulp magazine|pulp novels]] of the 1930s, he was later adapted into other forms of media, including on radio, in [[American comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[television]], serials, [[video game]]s, and at least five [[feature film]]s. The [[radio drama]] include episodes voiced by [[Orson Welles]].\n\nThe Shadow, originally created to be a mysterious radio show narrator,<ref name="Stedman">{{cite book | last = Stedman | first = Raymond William | title = Serials: Suspense and Drama By Installment | url = https://archive.org/details/serials00raym | url-access = registration | year = 1977 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | isbn = 978-0806116952 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/serials00raym/page/154 154] | quote = The definite article in The Shadow\'s name was always capitalized in the pulp adventures}}</ref> was developed into a distinct literary character in 1931 by writer [[Walter B. Gibson]].\n\nThe Shadow [[First appearance|debut]]ed on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the radio program \'\'Detective Story Hour\'\', which was developed to boost sales of [[Street & Smith]]\'s monthly pulp \'\'[[Detective Story Magazine]]\'\'.<ref name="RadioShow">{{Cite web| title = The Shadow: A Short Radio History | website=Old-time.com | url = http://www.old-time.com/sights/shadow.html | access-date = 2008-03-23}}</ref> When listeners of the program began asking at newsstands for copies of "that Shadow detective magazine", Street & Smith launched a magazine based on the character, and hired Gibson to create a concept to fit the name and voice and to write a story featuring him. The first issue of the [[Pulp magazine|pulp series]] \'\'[[The Shadow (magazine)|The Shadow Magazine]]\'\' went on sale April 1, 1931.\n\nOn September 26, 1937, \'\'The Shadow\'\', a new [[radio drama]] based on the character as created by Gibson for the pulp magazine, premiered with the story "The Death House Rescue", in which The Shadow was characterized as having "the hypnotic power to cloud men\'s minds so they cannot see him". In the magazine stories, The Shadow did not become literally invisible.\n\nThe introductory line from the radio adaptation of \'\'The Shadow\'\' – "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!" – spoken by actor [[Frank Readick]], has earned a place in the [[American English|American]] [[idiom]]. These words were accompanied by an [[ominous laugh]] and a musical theme, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]\' \'\'[[Le Rouet d\'Omphale]]\'\' ("Omphale\'s Spinning Wheel," composed in 1872).\n\nThe Shadow, at the end of each episode,  reminded listeners, "The weed of crime bears bitter fruit! Crime does not pay...The Shadow knows!"\n\nSome early episodes used the alternate statement, "As you sow evil, so shall you reap evil! Crime does not pay...The Shadow knows!"'}}}]}}}
