The character was created in 1959 by writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and artist [[Gil Kane]], and first appeared in \'\'[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]\'\' #22 (October 1959). Hal Jordan is a reinvention of the previous Green Lantern who appeared in 1940s comic books as the character [[Alan Scott]].\n\nHal Jordan is a former fighter pilot who works for Ferris Aircraft as a test pilot, a member and occasionally leader of an intergalactic police force called the [[Green Lantern Corps]], as well as a founding member of the [[Justice League]], DC\'s flagship superhero team, alongside well-known heroes such as [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. He fights evil across the universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers, but is usually portrayed as one of the protectors of Sector 2814, which is the sector where Earth resides. His powers derive from his [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] and Green Lantern battery, which in the hands of someone capable of overcoming great fear allows the user to channel their [[will (philosophy)|will power]] into creating all manner of fantastic constructs. Jordan uses this power to fly, even through the vacuum of space; to create shields, swords, and lasers; and to construct his Green Lantern costume, which protects his [[secret identity]] in his civilian life on Earth. Jordan and all other Green Lanterns are monitored and empowered by the mysterious [[Guardians of the Universe]], who were developed from an idea editor [[Julius Schwartz]] and Broome had originally conceived years prior in a story featuring [[Captain Comet]] in \'\'[[Strange Adventures]] #22\'\' (July 1952) entitled "Guardians of the Clockwork Universe".<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/03/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-148 comic book urban legends revealed #148], [[comicbookresources.com]]</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jordan also appeared as a villain. The story line \'\'Emerald Twilight\'\' saw a Jordan traumatized by the supervillain [[Mongul]]\'s destruction of Jordan\'s hometown [[Coast City]], adopt the name "[[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]", and threaten to destroy the universe.<ref>\'\'Green Lantern\'\' (vol. 3) #50: Emerald Twilight, Part Three: The Future</ref> In subsequent years, DC Comics rehabilitated the character, first by having Jordan seek redemption for his actions as Parallax, and later by revealing that Parallax was in fact an evil cosmic entity that corrupted Jordan and took control of his actions. Between the character\'s stint as Parallax and his return to DC Comics as a heroic Green Lantern once more, the character also briefly served as [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]], a supernatural character in DC Comics stories who acts as [[Presence (DC Comics)|God]]\'s wrathful agent on Earth.\n\nOutside of comics, Hal Jordan has appeared in various animated projects, video games and live-action. Jordan\'s original design in the comics was based on actor [[Paul Newman]],<ref name="stow">{{cite web |last1=Stowe |first1=Dusty |title=15 Things You Didn\'t Know About Green Lantern |url=https://screenrant.com/green-lantern-trivia-facts/#:~:text=6%20Hal%20Jordan%20Was%20Based%20On%20Paul%20Newman&text=Artist%20Gil%20Kane%20(who%20had,who%20moonlights%20as%20a%20superhero. |website=Screenrant.com |date=3 August 2017 |publisher=Valnet, Inc. |access-date=12 May 2022}}</ref> and the character is ranked 7th on [[IGN]]\'s in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/7|title=IGN\'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|access-date=9 July 2015}}</ref> In 2013, Hal Jordan placed 4th on [[IGN]]\'s Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |title=The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics |website=IGN |date=2013-11-19 |access-date=2015-11-01}}</ref>\n\nHal Jordan made his cinematic debut in the 2011 film \'\'[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]\'\', played by [[Ryan Reynolds]].'}}}]}}}
