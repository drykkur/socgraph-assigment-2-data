An [[international co-production]] between the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Panama and the United States,<ref name=AFI /> it was supervised by [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]], produced by their partner [[Pierre Spengler]] and written by [[Mario Puzo]] from a story by Puzo, and is the first installment in the [[Superman in film|Superman film series]]. Directed by [[Richard Donner]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Marlon Brando]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Jeff East]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Phyllis Thaxter]], [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Trevor Howard]], [[Marc McClure]], [[Terence Stamp]], [[Valerie Perrine]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Jack O\'Halloran]], [[Maria Schell]], and [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]. It depicts the origin of Superman (Reeve), including his infancy as Kal-El of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], son of Jor-El (Brando) and his youthful years in the rural town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. Disguised as reporter [[Clark Kent]], he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and develops a romance with [[Lois Lane]] (Kidder) whilst battling the villainous [[Lex Luthor]] (Hackman).\n\nIlya had the idea of a Superman film in 1973 and after a difficult process with DC Comics, the Salkinds and Spengler bought the rights to the character the following year. Several directors, most notably [[Guy Hamilton]], and screenwriters ([[Mario Puzo]], [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]], and [[Robert Benton]]), were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct. [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a "[[creative consultant]]" credit. It was decided to film both \'\'Superman\'\' and its sequel \'\'[[Superman II]]\'\' (1980) simultaneously, with [[principal photography]] beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions arose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Peter |last=Tonguette |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/36/lester1.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20101212005734/http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/36/lester1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 2010 |title=Bright Lights Film Journal :: The Superman Films of Richard Lester |publisher=Brightlightsfilm.com |access-date=June 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of most expensive films#Record-holders|most expensive film]] made up to that point, with a budget of $55&nbsp;million,<ref name="Cook (2000)">{{Cite book |last=Cook|first=David A.|year=2000|title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970–1979|volume=9 of History of the American Cinema, Richard Koszarski|publisher=[[Charles Scribner\'s Sons|Scribner]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUUNAQAAMAAJ&q=superman+%22$55+million+production%22 58]}}</ref><ref name=superman-tcm>{{cite web |title=Superman: The Movie (1978) – Articles |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/91973/Superman-The-Movie/articles.html |access-date=26 April 2012 |archive-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724083358/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/91973/Superman-The-Movie/articles.html |url-status=live }}</ref> \'\'Superman\'\' was released in December 1978 to critical and financial success; its worldwide box office earnings of $300&nbsp;million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year.
