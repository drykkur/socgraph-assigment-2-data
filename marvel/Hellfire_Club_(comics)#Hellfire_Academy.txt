The Hellfire Club often comes into confrontation with the mutant superhero team, the [[X-Men]].  Although the Club appears to merely be an international social club for wealthy elites, its clandestine \'\'\'Inner Circle\'\'\' seeks to influence world events, in accordance with their own agenda.\n\nCreated by the \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' writer/artist duo of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], they were heavily influenced by a 1966 episode of the British television series \'\'[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]\'\' ("[[A Touch of Brimstone]]").<ref name=xcompanion2>\'\'X-Men Companion II\'\'. 1982. Fantagraphics Books.</ref> The name "[[Hellfire Club]]" in fact has a historical precedent, having been a popular name for [[gentlemen\'s clubs]] in the 18th century. Additionally, the hierarchy of the Inner Circle is modeled on the pieces of a chess set, with Black and White sets of Kings, Queens, Bishops and Rooks.\n\nThe Hellfire Club and its Inner Circle were introduced in "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]", attempting to subvert the X-Men\'s [[Jean Grey]].<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #129-135</ref> This incarnation, composed most notably of Black King [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and White Queen [[Emma Frost]], would remain prominent for many years. After their initial confrontations, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men settled into an uneasy alliance.<ref name="uxm209">\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #209</ref><ref name="nm51">\'\'The New Mutants\'\' #51</ref> This eventually changed as endless power struggles perpetuated a series of upheavals within the Inner Circle. The club has appeared in two X-Men animated series (\'\'[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]\'\' and \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\'), both times being renamed as simply The Inner Circle, due to the aversion of using the term "hellfire" in a children\'s cartoon. Members of the Hellfire Club appeared in 2011\'s \'\'[[X-Men: First Class]]\'\' as the main villains, led by Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Azazel and Riptide. The Hellfire Clubâ€™s Inner Circle also appear as the main antagonists of the [[The Gifted (season 2)|second]] season of the television series \'\'[[The Gifted (American TV series)|The Gifted]]\'\' led by a character named Reeva Payge played by [[Grace Byers]], and the [[Stepford Cuckoos|Frost sisters]] played by [[Skyler Samuels]].'}}}]}}}
